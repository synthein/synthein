Rules
- The handed of canvas doesn't persist. They only exist in the draw functions.
	Width and height are stored and can change with a screen resize.
	To avoid confilicting information with the stored Width and Height.


Standard functions (plus proper order)
	cursorpressed
	cursorreleased
	pressed
	released
	wheelmoved
	update
	resize
	draw (for now pass in cursor position)
	
If cursor argument is not sufficent then add new function to cope with changes.
