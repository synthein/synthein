	Width and height are stored and can change with a screen resize.
	To avoid confilicting information with the stored Width and Height.


Standard functions (plus proper order)
	cursorpressed(cursor, control)
	cursorreleased(cursor, control)
	pressed(control)
	released(control)
	wheelmoved
	update
	resize
	draw (for now pass in cursor position)
	
If cursor argument is not sufficent then add new function to cope with changes.

The control argument will be bundled with each posible meaning
